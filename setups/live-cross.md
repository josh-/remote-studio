# Live Cross

A live cross is typically 'throw' (or temporary handover) of a show to a remote location and presenter, and is used
often in broadcast news.

We use this to remotely connect presenters to the remote studio so that they don't have to be on-location.

## The Setup

The production team will walk you through what you need to get dialed in - In most cases this will be a video call you
take from a web browser.

## The Process

### Pre-show

The production team will let you know what time to dial-in before the show goes to air on the day.

The producer will let you know ahead of time what to expect prior to going to air. This is typically a countdown that
you'll be able to hear.

The standard process is to wait for the countdown to reach 1, take a brief pause, then start presenting.

### On-air

While you're on-air, you'll be isolated and only able to hear the producer, and if needed, a minimal set of people who
need to be heard, such as an interviewer, or other member of the production team.

### Post-show

After the live cross is completed, the producer will let you know once it is safe to disconnect from your end.
