# Video Calls

If the setup requires you to be part of a video call, we'll let you know how you can 'dial-in' to our system, so that
we can hear and see you (and vice versa!)

Regardless of how you join the call, there's a few things you should consider!

## Video

Some terminology:

```
Frame: The image that we see from your webcam / camera.
```

### Framing!

You should aim to keep the camera around eye level. It doesn't have to be perfect! Ideally what we're trying to avoid is
looking up or down at you too sharply.

Keep an eye on how much 'headroom' you have - That is, if you look at the picture, the top of your head should not be at
the very top of the frame.  
Imagine being able to fit a tennis ball in the space between the top of your head, and the top of the picture.

### Lighting

Try to find a room that isn't too bright, or too dark - Your face should be brighter than your surroundings.

Bonus points - Other things to try:

* Use desk / floor lamps as an additional light source!
* Try finding a large white sheet (for example a bed sheet) and using it to reflect light - But keep it out of
  frame!

## Audio

### Microphone / Environment

Arguably the most important part of any video call! Making sure that people can hear you in a clear, crisp manner - The
way nature intended!

The aim is to get a microphone somewhere close to your mouth - Consistently.  
For this reason, headset-mounted boom mics work well! As do in-line microphones on earbuds (provided they're not
rustling up against anything).

You could alternatively use an external mic, or your laptop's built-in microphone. At this point the aim is to find a
room that doesn't echo too much!  
Hard surfaces reflect sound, so a room filled with couches, rugs, and even bookcases will absorb some unwanted echo.
Alternatively, a larger room might work better.

### Headphones

Because we will also send a return feed back to you (typically a producer's line), it's crucial that you use
headphones - Otherwise we might be able to hear an echo!

Try to use the most nondescript pair of headphones you own - They might be some old earbuds, AirPods, or even a
bluetooth headset!
